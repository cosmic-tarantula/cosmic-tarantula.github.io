      Hi, I am Steve!
    </div>

    <p>
    I am ML student researching statistical methodology in causal inference. My research interests revolve around designing statistically efficient algorithms for causl effect identification. I'm interested in doubly robust and debiased causal learning algorithms. More generally, I'm interested in understanding autonomous decision making.

    This website hosts my technical pages and portfolio. I aim to populate it with a mixture of theory and empirical portfolio consisting of benchmarking on real-world data.
